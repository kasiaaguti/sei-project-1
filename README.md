## Logic
​
Tetris is a puzzle game where the player has to fit different shaped blocks (called Tetriminos) together so that they make a complete line across the playing board. Once a line is achieved it is removed from the game board and the player's score is increased.

The player can move the Tetriminos left and right and rotate them clockwise in 90º increments.

The aim of the game is to get as many points as possible before the game board is filled with Tetriminos.

## Challenges

The larges challenge was the rotation of the Tetriminos. Each one rotates around a specific point on its axis. Also some Tetriminos, particularly the long bar, create problems issues when turning next to the walls of the game board. Furthermore, once a line has been made, the blocks above have to all shift down a row to fill the space, which requires a good amount of recursion.
